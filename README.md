   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
3. Run the installer:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

### Detailed Installation Guide

*Your step-by-step path to terminal nirvana*

#### What You'll Accomplish

By following this guide, you'll transform your Android device into a legitimate development powerhouse with custom tools for coding, file management, and getting stuff done.

**Estimated total setup time:** 30-45 minutes (the best investment you'll make this month)

#### Part 1: Installing Termux

##### Download Termux APK (Recommended Method)

1. Using your Android browser, visit: [F-Droid](https://search.f-droid.org/?q=termux)
2. Find and tap on "Termux" from the search results (Around the 9th option after Okc Agent and before TermuC)
3. Scroll down to "Download APK" and tap on the highest version number
4. Once downloaded, tap the APK file to install
5. If prompted about "Install unknown apps," enable the permission for your browser

> **Pro Tip:** F-Droid's version of Termux is the way to go. The Google Play version is like buying knockoff headphones—looks the same, works worse.

##### Install Termux:API

1. On the same search page, find "Termux:API"
2. Download and install the APK as you did with Termux
3. This companion app allows Termux to interact with your phone's features
4. Also grab yourself a copy of Termux:Styling for customizing the way your terminal looks (because who doesn't want a good-looking terminal?)

#### Part 2: Initial Termux Setup

##### Grant Storage Permissions

1. Open your Android **Settings** app
2. Navigate to **Apps** → **Termux** → **Permissions**
3. Enable **Storage** permission
4. For Android 11+, select **Files and media** and choose **Allow management of all files**

> **Remember:** A terminal without storage access is like a car without wheels—technically still a car, but not going anywhere useful.

##### Setup Termux Packages

1. Open **Termux** app
2. Update package database by typing:
   ```
   pkg update
   ```
   When prompted, type `y` to confirm

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pkg install proot-distro curl wget git termux-api
   ```
   When prompted, type `y` to confirm

4. Verify storage access by typing:
   ```
   ls /sdcard
   ```
   You should see your device's folders (Download, DCIM, etc.). If you see "Permission denied," review the permissions step.

5. Set up improved keyboard shortcuts:
   ```
   mkdir -p ~/.termux
   echo "extra-keys = [[ESC, TAB, CTRL, ALT, {key: '-'}, {key: '/'}, HOME, UP, END], [DEL, BACKSLASH, {key: '|'}, {key: '\"'}, {key: '\''}, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT]]" > ~/.termux/termux.properties
   termux-reload-settings
   ```

#### Part 3: Installing Ubuntu

1. In Termux, install Ubuntu:
   ```
   proot-distro install ubuntu
   ```
   This will take 5-15 minutes depending on your internet speed. Perfect time to grab a coffee or contemplate why you're installing Linux on your phone (because it's awesome, that's why).

2. Once complete, launch Ubuntu:
   ```
   proot-distro login ubuntu
   ```
   Your prompt will change, indicating you're now in Ubuntu. Welcome to Linux-land on your phone!

3. Update Ubuntu and install required packages:
   ```
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   apt install git curl wget python3 python3-pip vim nano tree htop -y
   ```

#### Part 4: Installing The Modular Bashrc System

1. Make sure you're in the Ubuntu home directory:
   ```
   cd ~
   ```

2. Clone or download the bashrc system:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dnoice/ultimate-termux-experience.git bashrc-system
   ```
   (If you've received the files via other means, use `cd /sdcard/Download` to access them, then copy to your home directory)

3. Navigate to the installation directory:
   ```
   cd bashrc-system
   ```

4. Make the installation script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

5. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
   Follow the on-screen prompts. For most questions, the default options (just press Enter) are fine.

6. Apply the configuration:
   ```
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   You should see a welcome message with system information. That warm fuzzy feeling? That's terminal enlightenment setting in.

#### Part 5: Verifying Installation

Let's verify everything is working properly:

1. Test shared storage access:
   ```
   sdcard
   ```
   You should be taken to your device's internal storage.

2. Return to home:
   ```
   home
   ```
   You should be taken back to `/root`.

3. Check system information:
   ```
   sm
   ```
   You should see system stats like CPU, memory usage, etc.

4. View all available commands:
   ```
   help
   ```
   This displays all the custom commands available in your new environment. It's like Christmas, but for your terminal.

### Manual Installation

For those who like to do things the hard way (we see you, and we respect your life choices):

1. Create the module directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.bashrc.d
   ```

2. Copy all module files (`*.sh`) to `~/.bashrc.d/`

3. Copy the main `.bashrc` file to your home directory:
   ```bash
   cp main-bashrc ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. (Optional) Configure Termux to auto-start Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   cp termux-bashrc ~/../../home/.bashrc
   ```

5. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## 🧩 Module Structure

The system is organized into the following modules (think of them as superpowers for your terminal):

1. **00-module-loader.sh**: The conductor of this terminal orchestra
2. **01-core-settings.sh**: Basic shell settings and environment configuration
3. **02-prompt.sh**: A command prompt that actually tells you useful things
4. **03-storage-navigation.sh**: Teleportation between Ubuntu and Android storage
5. **04-file-operations.sh**: File manipulation that doesn't make you cry
6. **05-git-integration.sh**: Git commands that respect your thumbs
7. **06-python-development.sh**: Python tools that understand mobile development
8. **07-system-management.sh**: Keep tabs on what your system is doing
9. **08-productivity-tools.sh**: Because tracking work makes you feel accomplished
10. **09-network-utilities.sh**: Internet tools for internet people
11. **10-custom-utilities.sh**: Miscellaneous magic for everything else

## 🔧 Key Commands

### General

- `help`: Show available commands (your new best friend)
- `lsmod`: List available modules
- `reload`: Reload all modules (for when you make changes)
- `bashrc <module>`: Edit a specific module

### Storage Navigation

- `sdcard`: Jump to Android shared storage
- `home`: Return to Ubuntu home directory
- `scd <folder>`: Navigate to a folder in shared storage
- `where`: Show current path relative to sdcard (for when you're lost in directory land)

### Development

- `p <project>`: Navigate to a project
- `a`: Activate Python virtual environment (laziness is efficiency)
- `pyproject <name>`: Create a new Python project structure
- `gclone <user/repo>`: Clone a GitHub repository with insights

### Productivity

## 🩹 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### If you can't access shared storage:
- Verify Termux has storage permissions in Android settings
- Try the direct path with `cd ../sdcard`
- Run `ls /sdcard` in Termux (before Ubuntu) to check direct access

### If commands aren't working in Ubuntu:
- Ensure you're in the Ubuntu environment by checking if the prompt changed
- Try running `reload` to refresh all modules
- Verify installation completed without errors

### If Ubuntu seems slow:
- This is normal - Ubuntu runs in a container on your phone
- Close background apps for better performance
- Patience is key with mobile Linux environments (Rome wasn't built on a 5.5" screen)

## 🎨 Customization

Make it yours! After all, a terminal without customization is like pizza without toppings—it works, but why settle?

You can create a custom configuration file at `~/.bashrc.custom` to add your own settings, which will be loaded after all modules.

To enable verbose module loading:

```bash
export VERBOSE_MODULE_LOAD=1
```

To disable the welcome message:

```bash
export DISABLE_WELCOME=1
```

## 🧠 Additional Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check module loading with verbose mode:
   ```bash
   export VERBOSE_MODULE_LOAD=1
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Inspect individual modules:
   ```bash
   bashrc <module_name>
   ```

3. Reload the configuration:
   ```bash
   reload
   ```

4. Restore original PATH if needed:
   ```bash
   restore_path
   ```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Why use this instead of just regular Termux?**  
A: Regular Termux is powerful but has limitations, especially with Python packages that have C dependencies. This system uses proot-distro Ubuntu where these packages "just work" while adding quality-of-life improvements for mobile development.

**Q: Will this drain my battery?**  
A: Running a full Linux environment does use more resources than standard Android apps, but it's designed to be efficient. Close Ubuntu when not in use with `exit` to save power.

**Q: How much storage space does this require?**  
A: Expect around 1-2GB for the basic setup. Additional space will be needed for your projects and any extra packages you install.

**Q: Can I use this on a tablet?**  
A: Absolutely! In fact, tablets provide more screen space which makes terminal work even more comfortable.

**Q: Does this require root access?**  
A: No! Everything runs in a contained environment using proot-distro. No root required.

### Development Questions

**Q: Can I run Django/Flask/FastAPI servers?**  
A: Yes! They install cleanly and run perfectly inside Ubuntu. Just bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost and use the appropriate port forwarding.

**Q: What about heavy data science libraries like pandas and numpy?**  
A: They work! That's one of the biggest advantages of this setup. Inside proot-distro Ubuntu, these libraries install without the dependency nightmares you'd face in regular Termux.

**Q: Can I connect to GitHub without typing my password every time?**  
A: Yes, set up SSH keys with `ssh-keygen` and add them to your GitHub account. The git integration supports this workflow.

**Q: How do I develop and test Android apps?**  
A: While you can write the code in this environment, you'll still need Android Studio for building and testing. Consider this your mobile code editor and version control system.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I access my Android files from Ubuntu?**  
A: Use the `sdcard` command to jump to shared storage, or `scd <folder>` to go to a specific folder. The system handles all the path mapping automatically.

**Q: Can I run GUI applications?**  
A: Not directly. This is a terminal-based environment. However, you can install a VNC server and client if you really need GUI applications.

**Q: How do I update the modular bashrc system?**  
A: Pull the latest changes from GitHub, then run the installer again or manually update the modules you want to refresh.

**Q: Can I use VSCode or other code editors?**  
A: You can use terminal-based editors like vim, nano, or emacs. For GUI editors, consider setting up a remote development environment and connecting to it.

**Q: What if I want to uninstall everything?**  
A: In Termux, run `proot-distro remove ubuntu` to remove Ubuntu. Remove the bashrc files with `rm -rf ~/.bashrc.d` and restore your original .bashrc.

### Customization Questions

**Q: Can I add my own modules?**  
A: Absolutely! Create new .sh files in the ~/.bashrc.d directory following the naming convention (XX-name.sh). They'll be loaded automatically.

**Q: How do I change the command prompt style?**  
A: Edit the 02-prompt.sh module to customize your prompt appearance.

**Q: Can I disable modules I don't use?**  
A: Yes, either remove them from ~/.bashrc.d or rename them to end with .disabled instead of .sh.

**Q: How do I add my own Python environment tools?**  
A: Edit 06-python-development.sh to add your own Python-related functions and settings.
